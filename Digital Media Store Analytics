#Here I have a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, customerId, country
    FROM chinook.customers
    WHERE country <> 'US';

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT * FROM chinook.customers
    WHERE country = 'Brazil';

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT c.firstname, c.lastname, i.invoiceid, i.invoicedate, i.billingcountry
    FROM chinook.invoices as i
    LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as c ON i.customerId=c.CustomerId
    WHERE i.billingcountry = 'Brazil';

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT * FROM chinook.employees
    WHERE title = 'Sales Support Agent';  

#5. Find a unique list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT distinct billingcountry
    FROM chinook.invoices;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT e.firstname, e.lastname, i.invoiceid
    FROM chinook.employees as e
    JOIN chinook.customers as c ON e.employeeid=c.supportrepid
    JOIN chinook.invoices as i ON i.customerid=c.customerid;

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT c.firstname, c.lastname, c.country, e.firstname, e.lastname, i.total
    FROM chinook.employees as e
    JOIN chinook.customers as c ON e.employeeid=c.supportrepid
    JOIN chinook.invoices as i ON i.customerid=c.customerid;

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM chinook.Invoices
  WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(total) 
    FROM chinook.invoices
    WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT items.invoicelineid, t.name
    FROM chinook.invoice_items as items
    JOIN chinook.tracks as t
        ON items.trackid=t.trackid;

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT items.invoicelineid, t.name as track, art.name as artist
    FROM chinook.invoice_items as items
    LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks as t ON items.trackid=t.trackid
    INNER JOIN chinook.albums as alb ON t.albumid=alb.albumid
    LEFT JOIN chinook.artists as art ON art.artistid=alb.artistid;

#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT t.name as track, alb.title as album, m.name as media, g.name as genre
    FROM chinook.tracks as t

    JOIN chinook.genres as g ON t.genreid=g.genreid
    JOIN chinook.albums as alb ON t. albumid=alb.albumid;

#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT e.firstname, e.lastname, ROUND(SUM(i.total), 2) as 'Total Sales'
    FROM chinook.customers as cust
    JOIN chinook.invoices as i ON i.customerid=cust.customerid
    JOIN chinook.employees as e ON cust.supportrepid=e.employeeid
    WHERE e.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
    GROUP BY e.lastname;

#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

    JOIN chinook.employees as e ON cust.supportrepid=e.employeeid
    WHERE e.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
    AND i.invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31'
    GROUP BY e.lastname
    ORDER BY 'Total Sales' ASC
    LIMIT 1;
